# Python-Challenge UCD 2021
In this challenge, I created a Ptyhon script to analyze a set of financial data and a set of polling data. My goal was to have my script print out an analysis of each data set, to present the data in a concise and easily understood format. 

Initially appeared on [gist](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2). But the page cannot open anymore so that is why I have moved it here.
